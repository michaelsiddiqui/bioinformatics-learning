# bioinformatics-learning
repository to store code drafted and refined in response to bioinformatics lesson prompts

## UCSD Bioinformatics I - Hidden Messages

The initial content in this repo is to track Python packages that incorporate code built in response to the first two weeks of content in the UCSD Bioinformatics I (Finding Hidden Messages in DNA) course. The initial code content I produced for solving the problems in the Stepik prompts was developed in Jupyter notebooks, but functionality needed to solve later week prompts builds on past algorithms in a way that would benefit from writing some Python modules collected in a simple package.

### notebooks

The subdirectory `notebooks/hidden_messages` here contains notebook content initially written in response to prompts.

### base

The subdirectory `base/` contains Python package content intended to constitute the functionality necessary to address the Bioinformatics I course prompts

### tests

The subdirectory `base/tests` contains modules with unittest suite classes intended to enable testing the base package code using the example validation and debugging prompts provided in the Bioinformatics I course.
